## Introduction

In this document we perform exploratory data analysis on `Vegas Strip`
dataaset to see if there is any relationship between different amenities
which hotels provide and the score which guests give to those hotels on
the strip. This exploratory analysis will then be extended to see if a
predictive regression model can be developed to estimate user ratings
based on hotel amenities.

Loading required libraries

``` r
# loading required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
library(repr)
library(gridExtra)
```

Before doing any EDA splitting dataset into training and test set.

``` r
# reading dataset 
vegas_data <- read_csv2("../data/raw/vegas_data.csv")
```

    ## Using ',' as decimal and '.' as grouping mark. Use read_delim() for more control.

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Nr. reviews` = col_double(),
    ##   `Nr. hotel reviews` = col_double(),
    ##   `Helpful votes` = col_double(),
    ##   Score = col_double(),
    ##   `Hotel stars` = col_double(),
    ##   `Nr. rooms` = col_double(),
    ##   `Member years` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
#splitting into training test data set  based on hotel names
set.seed(787)
train_index <- caret::createDataPartition(vegas_data$`Hotel name`,  p = 0.75, list = FALSE)
training_set <- vegas_data[train_index,]
test_set <- vegas_data[- train_index,]

dim(training_set)
```

    ## [1] 378  20

``` r
dim(test_set)
```

    ## [1] 126  20

## Cleaning and wrangling data

Checking top rows and column names of the dataset.

``` r
head(training_set)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 20

    ## 4 UK                        14                7              14     4
    ## 5 UK                        45               12              46     4
    ## 6 USA                        2                1               4     4
    ## # ... with 15 more variables: `Period of stay` <chr>, `Traveler type` <chr>,
    ## #   Pool <chr>, Gym <chr>, `Tennis court` <chr>, Spa <chr>, Casino <chr>, `Free

    ## #   month` <chr>, `Review weekday` <chr>

``` r
colnames(training_set)
```

    ##  [1] "User country"      "Nr. reviews"       "Nr. hotel reviews"
    ##  [4] "Helpful votes"     "Score"             "Period of stay"   
    ##  [7] "Traveler type"     "Pool"              "Gym"              
    ## [10] "Tennis court"      "Spa"               "Casino"           
    ## [13] "Free internet"     "Hotel name"        "Hotel stars"      
    ## [16] "Nr. rooms"         "User continent"    "Member years"     
    ## [19] "Review month"      "Review weekday"

The dataset has 20 columns, out of which 19 are features and `Score` is
response variable for which relationship based on estimators need to be
determined.

The column/feature names are clearly not tidyverse compliant and have
white spaces which are a bit difficult to deal with during data
analysis.

``` r
#changing column names

colnames(training_set) <- c("user_country", "num_reviews", "num_hotel_reviews", "helpful_votes", "score", "stay_period", "traveller_type", "pool", "gym", "tennis_court", "spa", "casino", "free_internet", "hotel_name", "hotel_stars", "rooms", "user_continent", "member_years", "review_month", "review_weekday")

Checking for any NAs in the dataset.

``` r
any(is.na(training_set))
```

    ## [1] FALSE

This is good as we **do not have any NAs** in the dataset.

Checking datatype for individual columns in
    dataset.

``` r
str(training_set)
```

    ##                     Max.   :   13.0000

Clearly based on summary statistics, the column `member_years` has
negative values which seems incorrect as number of years of membership
of a customer cannot be negative.

``` r
sort(training_set$member_years)[1:10]
```

    ##  [1] -1806     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0

Replacing the minimum value by 0 as it logically makes sense to do so.

``` r
training_set[training_set$member_years== -1806,"member_years" ] = 0 

min(training_set$member_years)
```

    ## [1] 0

## Exploring relationship between features and hotel scores

Now we have clean data with no NA values, we can start inspecting
individual features to see if we can identify any relationship between
target score and the
    features.

``` r
str(training_set)
```

    ## Classes 'tbl_df', 'tbl' and 'data.frame':    378 obs. of  20 variables:
    ##  $ user_country     : chr  "USA" "USA" "USA" "UK" ...
    ##  $ num_reviews      : num  11 119 36 14 45 2 24 12 102 20 ...
    ##  $ num_hotel_reviews: num  4 21 9 7 12 1 3 7 24 9 ...
    ##  $ helpful_votes    : num  13 75 25 14 46 4 8 11 58 24 ...
    ##  $ score            : num  5 3 5 4 4 4 4 3 2 3 ...
    ##  $ stay_period      : chr  "Dec-Feb" "Dec-Feb" "Mar-May" "Mar-May" ...
    ##  $ traveller_type   : chr  "Friends" "Business" "Families" "Friends" ...
    ##  $ pool             : chr  "NO" "NO" "NO" "NO" ...
    ##  $ gym              : chr  "YES" "YES" "YES" "YES" ...
    ##  $ tennis_court     : chr  "NO" "NO" "NO" "NO" ...
    ##  $ spa              : chr  "NO" "NO" "NO" "NO" ...
    ##  $ casino           : chr  "YES" "YES" "YES" "YES" ...
    ##  $ free_internet    : chr  "YES" "YES" "YES" "YES" ...
    ##  $ hotel_name       : chr  "Circus Circus Hotel & Casino Las Vegas" "Circus Circus Hotel & Casino Las Vegas" "Circus Circus Hotel & Casino Las Vegas" "Circus Circus Hotel & Casino Las Vegas" ...
    ##  $ hotel_stars      : num  3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
    ##  $ rooms            : num  3773 3773 3773 3773 3773 ...
    ##  $ user_continent   : chr  "North America" "North America" "North America" "Europe" ...
    ##  $ member_years     : num  9 3 2 6 4 0 3 5 9 4 ...
    ##  $ review_month     : chr  "January" "January" "February" "February" ...
    ##  $ review_weekday   : chr  "Thursday" "Friday" "Saturday" "Friday" ...

Clearly the dataset has two kind of features.

  - **User specific** : user\_country, member\_years, user\_continent,
    traveller\_type etc.
  - **Hotel Specific** : rooms, free\_internet, hotel\_stars etc.

And within each category we have both categorical and numerical
features.

We can first re-arrange columns for better interpretation and **remove
hotel name** column as we do not want it to be one of the
features.

``` r
training_set <- training_set[c("user_country", "user_continent", "traveller_type",  "stay_period","review_month", "review_weekday", "member_years", "num_reviews", "helpful_votes", "pool", "gym", "tennis_court", "spa", "casino", "free_internet", "hotel_stars", "rooms", "num_hotel_reviews","score")]

head(training_set)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 19
    ##   user_country user_continent traveller_type stay_period review_month
    ##   <chr>        <chr>          <chr>          <chr>       <chr>

    ## 2 USA          North America  Business       Dec-Feb     January     
    ## 3 USA          North America  Families       Mar-May     February    
    ## 4 UK           Europe         Friends        Mar-May     February    
    ## 5 UK           Europe         Couples        Mar-May     April       
    ## 6 USA          North America  Families       Mar-May     April       
    ## # ... with 14 more variables: review_weekday <chr>, member_years <dbl>,
    ## #   num_reviews <dbl>, helpful_votes <dbl>, pool <chr>, gym <chr>,
    ## #   tennis_court <chr>, spa <chr>, casino <chr>, free_internet <chr>,
    ## #   hotel_stars <dbl>, rooms <dbl>, num_hotel_reviews <dbl>, score <dbl>

Creating vectors for different categories of
features.

``` r
user_specific_features <- c("user_country", "user_continent", "traveller_type",  "stay_period","review_month", "review_weekday", "member_years", "num_reviews", "helpful_votes")

hotel_specific_features <- c("pool", "gym", "tennis_court", "spa", "casino", "free_internet", "hotel_stars", "rooms", "num_hotel_reviews")


categorical_features <- c("user_country", "user_continent", "traveller_type",  "stay_period","review_month", "review_weekday", "pool", "gym", "tennis_court", "spa", "casino", "free_internet", "hotel_stars")

numerical_features <- c( "member_years", "num_reviews", "helpful_votes",  "rooms", "num_hotel_reviews")
```

We already explored the numerical features and checked min/max values
using `summary()` statistics earlier. Lets try exploring the
`categorical features`.

``` r
for (category in categorical_features){
  print(category)
  print(table(training_set[category]))
  cat("\n")
  cat("\n")
}
```

Interestingly, to our surprise there are a few hotels on Vegas Strip
which do not have casino.

Also based on initial exploration of individual groups in each category;
we are suspicious that users’ `countries` should not have an impact on
the hotel score. Also there were more visitors from some of the
countries(USA, Canada, Australia) as compared to others(France etc.).
Plus we may have a new user from different country so our model will
more potentially fail to generalize and it might be a good idea to use
`user_continents` instead. We will however do some more visualization
analysis to confirm
same.

### Inspecting relationship between hotel scores and categorical features

Creating a function to plot categorical features against score

``` r
# function to create plot for categorical features


plot_categorical <- function(df, col_name_x, col_name_y = "score"){
  
  p <-  ggplot(df, aes_string(x = col_name_x, y  = col_name_y))+
    geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun.y = "mean", fill = "royalblue3")+
    geom_jitter()+
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5),panel.background = element_rect(fill =   "lavender"))+
    ggtitle(paste("Average ", col_name_y," vs ", col_name_x))
  p
}

# list to hold plots

cat_plots <- vector('list', length(categorical_features))

cat_plots <- lapply(categorical_features, plot_categorical, df = training_set)

options(repr.plot.height = 10, repr.plot.width = 8)

grid.arrange(cat_plots[[1]], cat_plots[[2]], cat_plots[[3]],  layout_matrix = rbind(c(1,1),c(2,3)))
```

#### Observations

  - Clearly based on the plots, some of the categorical features have
    signiciant impact on average user scores for hotels while others
    have minimal impact.

  - As analyzed earlier, based on plots of `score vs country` and `score
    vs continents`; it makes sense to use continents to study the
    relationship based on continents as compared to countries. This will
    help in better generalization of model.

  - Most of the `Traveller types` seem to give similar averge hotel
    ratings with an exception of `Solo` travelers who rated hotels a bit
    lower. The travellers who visited in groups of friends rated the
    hotels higher as compared to other travel groups.

  - Features `stay_period` and `review_weekday` seems to have same
    similar average scores for all stay periods and review days
    respectively. The average scores however sligtly seems to dip for
    mid-week reviews(Wednesday). We might need to see if these features
    can be removed from the model altogether to analyze/predict average
    scores.

  - Amenities like `gym`,`tennis_court`, and `spa` seems to have slight
    positive impact on hotel scores. We however might need to check any
    collinearity within these features. Having a `pool` however improves
    hotel scores signiciantly.

  - For each `review_month`, there were small variations in score; it
    will however be a good idea to reduce the number of categories to
    four quarters rather than 12 months.

  - Providing visitors with `free internet` seems to improve hotel
    scores signicantly.

  - Although there is a small sample of hotels with no `casino` but
    those seems to have been rated better than the ones with casino. We
    will need to check if this is just due to class imbalance.

  - Different `Hotel stars` show variations in user scores. The trend
    needs to be investigated though.

Performing some wrangling based on the observations to further polish
the dataset.

``` r
# removing user_countries column

training_set <- training_set[, -c(1)]

# Re-categorizing review months as quarters of a year rather than individual months. 
training_set$review_month <- factor(training_set$review_month)

levels(training_set$review_month) = list("Q1" = c("January", "February", "March"),
                                       "Q2" = c("April", "May", "June"),
                                       "Q3" = c("July", "August", "September"),
                                       "Q4" = c("October", "November", "December"))


# Re-categorizing review_weekday as weekends and weekdays rather than days of the week. 
# including Friday in weekend category

training_set$review_weekday <- factor(training_set$review_weekday)
levels(training_set$review_weekday) <- list("Weekday" = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday"),
                                            "Weekend" = c("Friday","Saturday", "Sunday"))


# renaming these columns 

colnames(training_set)[4:5] <- c("review_quarter", "review_day")

# updating categorical feature vector 
categorical_features <- categorical_features[-1]
categorical_features[4:5] <- c("review_quarter", "review_day")

# updating user_specific feature vector
user_specific_features <- user_specific_features[-1]
user_specific_features[4:5] <- c("review_quarter", "review_day")
```

Visualizing updated relationship plots for these variables.

``` r
# list to hold plots

cat_plots <- vector('list', length(categorical_features))

cat_plots <- lapply(categorical_features, plot_categorical, df = training_set)

grid.arrange(cat_plots[[4]], cat_plots[[5]])
```

![](EDA_vegas_strip_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)<!-- -->

### Inspecting relationship between hotel scores and numeric features

Having explored relationship between categorical features and target
score. Lets see how continous features affect hotel scores.

``` r
ggpairs(training_set, c(numerical_features, "score"))+
   theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill =   "lavender"))
```

![](EDA_vegas_strip_data_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png)<!-- -->

Clearly based on the plot above we can see that there is not much
correlation between numeric features and the scores. This theoretically
makes sense as number of reviews from users, number of hotel reviews
etc. should have minimal impact on scores. But it might not be a good
idea to remove these features at this stage. We can first create
baseline model and do further feature engineering.

## Summary of EDA

  - Based on the exploratory data analysis of different features, we see
    that some features like having a pool, free internet etc.
    signiciantly improves hotel scores while other features like most of
    numeric features, review days etc. do not seem to have any
    significant impact on average hotel scores.

  - Two of the features/columns - user\_country and hotel\_names were
    removed as based on EDA, those either do not contribute to the
    average hotel score or their contribution cannot be generalized.
    There are other features which may be removed but we will first
    create a baseline model and compare relative feature importances
    with EDA analysis and then do feature reduction.

## Next Steps

The planned next course of action is as follows.

  - Do pre-processing of dataset before developing linear
    regression(and/or other generalized linear regression models)
  - Develop models
  - Feature engineering based on results
  - Improve models(iterative)
  - Report final results
